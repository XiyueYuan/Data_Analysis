### Opening
This repo tracks my journey exploring crypto and stock markets using Python — mainly with `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and a bit of SQL.
It’s my way of practicing data analysis regularly and getting my hands dirty with real market data.

The file knowledge.md documents everything I’ve learned along the way — kind of like a personal notebook that can also serve as a beginner-friendly handbook for anyone starting out in data analysis.
